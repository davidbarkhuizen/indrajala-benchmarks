Old `f59388b` against new `f59388b`, run with `scripts/measurement/ab.py`: passes in the order ONNONO. Each pass ran `python scripts/measurement/sequence_training_timing.py --windows 256 --repeats 1 --features 512 --heads 8` (the script from the new tree) in its own process tree, from a neutral working directory with only its side's tree on `PYTHONPATH`. Before each pass a probe checked that the trainer module imported from that tree and that the crate extension was that side's release build: old crate `4dba70e` (extension sha256 `f5c8b6404a1d`) and new crate `ce5a267` (extension sha256 `24bdf26aceef`), each a cached wheel installed with `pip --target` into a directory on `PYTHONPATH` after the tree, so the venv was never touched. Machine check: profile: identity matches (i7-9700k.json); max 1-min load 0.47 (measured just after this run's crate builds); busy processes: none. Each row pools 3 runs per side.

- controls: none (a probe row can carry "control": true)
- 4 rows within noise, max |Δ| 0.6%
