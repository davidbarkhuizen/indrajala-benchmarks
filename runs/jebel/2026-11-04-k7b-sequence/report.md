Old `0d91d1a` against new `0d91d1a`, run with `scripts/measurement/ab.py`: passes in the order ONNONO. Each pass ran `python scripts/measurement/sequence_training_timing.py --windows 1024 --repeats 2` (the script from the new tree) in its own process tree, from a neutral working directory with only its side's tree on `PYTHONPATH`. Before each pass a probe checked that the trainer module imported from that tree and that the crate extension was that side's release build: old crate `6a8190c` (extension sha256 `84ec4e85d91b`) and new crate `7b9878f` (extension sha256 `21b07c2bef84`), each a cached wheel installed with `pip --target` into a directory on `PYTHONPATH` after the tree, so the venv was never touched. Machine check: profile: identity matches (i7-9700k.json); max 1-min load 3.56 (HIGH); busy processes: none. Each row pools 3 runs per side.

- controls: none (a probe row can carry "control": true)
- 4 rows within noise (1 separated inside their spread), max |Δ| 0.7%
